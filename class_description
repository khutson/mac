Electronics for Everyone

Arduino for Everyone

Arduino for Everyone is a 3-part class that will teach you everything you need to know to get started in the world of Arduino microcomputers. We'll start with the basics - how to set up and program an Arduino. As the class progresses, we'll learn to read and control lights, servos, sensors, and anything else you might want to add to your next project.
You don't need any electronics experience whatsoever. Just bring your laptop. We'll supply the Arduino and the parts you need to get started.
