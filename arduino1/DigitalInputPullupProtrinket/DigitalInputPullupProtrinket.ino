 Input Pullup Serial

 This example demonstrates the use of pinMode(INPUT_PULLUP). It reads a
 digital input on pin buttonPin and prints the results to the serial monitor.

 The circuit:
 * Momentary switch attached from pin buttonPin to ground
 * Built-in LED on pin ledPin

 Unlike pinMode(INPUT), there is no pull-down resistor necessary. An internal
 20K-ohm resistor is pulled to 5V. This configuration causes the input to
 read HIGH when the switch is open, and LOW when it is closed.

const int buttonPin = 4;
const int ledPin = 3;

void setup() {
  //configure pinbuttonPin as an input and enable the internal pull-up resistor
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT_PULLUP);
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);

}

void loop() {
  //read the pushbutton value into a variable
  int sensorVal = digitalRead(buttonPin);

  // Keep in mind the pullup means the pushbutton's
  // logic is inverted. It goes HIGH when it's open,
  // and LOW when it's pressed. Turn on pin ledPin when the
  // button's pressed, and off when it's not:
  if (sensorVal == HIGH) {
    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
  } else {
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  }
}
